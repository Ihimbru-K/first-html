I passed the entrance exams into the department of Computer Engineering of NAHPI in the 2020/2021 academic year.
We were introduced to basic engineering concepts and courses such as Introduction to Engineering, Engineering Mathematics I and II, physics, chemistry, computer science, mechanics and many more.
As from the second year, we focused more on departmental courses such as software engineering, web programming, embedded systems, digital systems design and many more. We were being given an awareness 
on engineering concepts for aspiring computer engineers. This is all I am going to write for today thank you.
